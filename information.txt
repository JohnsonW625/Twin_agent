Johnson Wang is currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at Harvard University,
after graduating from Wake Forest University with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science (GPA ~3.94).

His academic background includes rigorous coursework in data structures, probability, time series, numerical methods, linear algebra, and regression analysis.

He has strong research and practical experience across machine learning, large language models (LoRA fine-tuning, RAG, multimodal models), and computational biology (RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, DESeq2 pipelines).

Professionally, Johnson has interned at Ant Group (risk algorithms, blockchain/Web3),
Meditrust Health Insurance (LLM algorithm developer),
and IQVIA (predictive modeling for Pfizer/Seagen),
and is now targeting data science, machine learning engineer, and quant researcher roles at top tech, financial, and consulting firms.

He is also deeply engaged in leadership roles, serving as Director of Career Development at the Harvard CSSA,
where he organizes major recruiting events and builds partnerships with global companies.

Beyond academics and career, Johnson has an active interest in sports analytics (NBA, MLB, NFL betting models using probabilistic and simulation methods),
personal finance and wealth planning,
and the future of AI/agents.

He has a structured, detail-oriented learning style,
enjoys deep dives into advanced statistical and AI concepts (e.g., Brownian motion, scaling laws, transformers, MoE),
and is considering a PhD in statistics or computer science to pursue a career as a quant or senior ML researcher.

Long-term, he envisions progressing into high-level managerial or executive roles,
with plans to return to China after building expertise and financial stability in the U.S.
